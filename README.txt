# Replication_project




The vaccines project was becoming a little unwieldy so I separated it into several files.  They all call #1 automatically though to be able to run.  Also, files 2-4 are all basically copies of each other where I changed small things using Control-F to tailor the file to the specific model I was working on.  

all plots for these R files go into "images vaccines"


"R_replication_politics.R" is the replication data for the when corrections fail paper.  This is in only one file because it was easier. 

all plots for this file go into "images politics"

"R_Run_All" just sources all the other files.  So you can delete all the pdfs in the images files if you'd like, and run everything from here and they'd repopulate without errors (i've tried several times). 

Both Nyhan-Reifler files have the STATA files, and the R "translations" I saved the transations here, to the point where they perfectly mimmic the STATA do.files. 

"garbage" should be self explanatory.
